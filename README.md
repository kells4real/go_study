# Go_STUDY

### A bunch of random exercise, functions, logics, tests, algorithms, and tests while studying the Go programming language. This my journey of understanding the GoLang documented.

###

### I will be writing most of the logics, functions or algorithms in this repo in both Go and Python. I find that I learn even better when I'm studying a language while comparing it with a language I can already strongly type in. It helps me understand the language I am studying in contrast to the one I already know. I choose Python for this mainly because Python can be run almost anywhere on any project structure without having to setup anything. 

### For example, if the project root folder is opened in visual studio code, you can run the python files directly by just typing in windows

``` 
python file.py
```
### While for Linux or Mac
``` 
python3 file.py
```
### To run the Go files, you run the main.go file
```
go run main.go
```
### The python codes on this repo are written on version 3.10, so there are some features used that may not be available for previous versions of python. You can edit these though if you are running a version lower than 3.10

#### Will continually update this readme as I progress.
